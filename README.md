# What it is

My site!  I got sick of hosting this myself on AWS and dealing with the security updates that come with AWS/Linux/Wordpress/MySql.  I could have either paid more for someone/thing to manage this for me, or went simpler and go interpreted static.  So moving to [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) seemed like the best option.  Plus, it gave me a reason to play with new tech.
