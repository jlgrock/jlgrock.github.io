# About Me

![Just me](/assets/img/justin-uzbec-restaurant.jpg) 
My name is Justin Grant.  I currently work at [Deloitte Consulting](https://www2.deloitte.com/global/en/services/consulting-deloitte.html). If you want to know more about my current status, check me out on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jlgrock/).

I'm a proponent of [open source software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software).  I spend quite a bit of time helping organizations move from monolithic platforms to horizontally scalable microservices platforms, usually utilizing one or more forms of [NoSQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NoSQL) data stores.

I went to college at [University of Michigan](http://www.umich.edu), getting my undergraduate degree in **Computer Science in Engineering**.  I started my career as a [Database Administrator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_administrator), starting with Oracle and then transitioning to MS-SQL and PostgreSQL. I transitioned to [Java](https://www.java.com/) and [Hadoop](https://hadoop.apache.org/) [data lakes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_lake) and all the interesting things surrounding loading data into data lakes and searching for data within the unstructured data.

At this point, I act in the capacity of a Systems Architect.  I interpret enterprise architecture documentation, do solutioning, create a design, proof of concept based on capacity plans and SLAs, and direct teams to create the software (helping when necessary).
