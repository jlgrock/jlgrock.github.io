# Secrets of Google Email


OK, it's actually kinda hard to find this on the internet, even though it was public knowledge a while back

## Feature #1: Periods in Emails

You can create an email crazy.dave@gmail.com and if you send an email to crazydave@gmail.com, it goes to the same user.
Usernames ignore periods.  Similarly, you can add extra periods, for example c.r.a.z.y.d.a.v.e@gmail.com will still go 
to that same user.

Also to prove this, try and create a new Google account , type 5 letters and a dot (e.g. "cra.da") - and it will say " 
Please use between 6 and 30 characters."

## Why This is Cool: Give it away Twice!

By being able to vary your email address "crazy.dave@gmail.com" vs "cra.zyda.ve@gmail.com", you can sign up for emails 
twice on bargain sites.

## Feature #2: Plus in Emails

You can add a plus at the end of your email, for example "crazy.dave@gmail.com" can add additional info that will be 
ignored.  For example, you could send an email to "crazy.dave+1234@gmail.com" and "+1234" will be dropped off and it
will be sent to "crazy.dave@gmail.com"

## Why This is Cool:  Sorting!

Because of this feature, you can [create sorting rules](http://lycoming.org/seniornet/howto/gmail3rule.shtml)
so that "crazy.dave+newsletters@gmail.com" goes to one folder and "crazy.dave+shopping@gmail.com" goes to another.

## Gmail's Advanced Searching

While Gmail's basic search works well enough, there are really fun advanced options that can help you find exactly 
what you are looking for.

For example, entering <strong>has:attachment filename:pdf</strong> will show you a list 
of e-mails with pdf files attached or `after: 12/06/2014 before: 14/06/2014` will offer up a 
list of messages from that specific time period.

You can view the major search operators over at the 
[Gmail support site](http://mail.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?answer=7190&amp;hl=en) — it's well worth memorizing 
a few.

## Why it's Cool: Seriously?

OK, if you can't figure out why this one is cool, I can't help you.

## Sad That This is All I Have?
