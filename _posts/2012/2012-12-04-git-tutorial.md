OK, anyone who has to push newer technology has had to do one or more of these.  A presentation on something that a million others have done already.  Well, I just went through intensive training with the folks that work at [GitHub](http://www.github.com), so who knows, maybe I'm bringing a little something new to a presentation.  Except my company didn't give me tons of time to flush it out.  I digress...

Anyways, for anyone I know, it might be helpful.  Feel free to modify it.  I also have the code out there in war form so you can download, modify, and quick deploy wherever you want.  The code is located [here](https://github.com/jlgrock/gitDemo).  Technically, it's two demos, each running about an hour to present.  There's some nice customizations in there for all of you regular Git users though.  Also, if you want to see it, feel free to check the Demo out on this website, as this site is what I used for my demo platform anyways.
