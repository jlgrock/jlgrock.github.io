This is a long time ago, when I first learned how to play Harmonica in Chicago.  I was learning from a very talented individual named [Joe Filisko](http://www.filisko.com/) at the [Old Town School of Folk Music](https://www.oldtownschool.org/).  This performance took place at the [Harlem Avenue Lounge](http://www.harlemavenuelounge.com/), which is a great place to have a drink and take in some culture.  You can even stop by for some sliders at the White Castle next door.  I was playing "Bring Me Another Half a Pint", originally by Sonny Boy Williamson.

Also, if you are curious, here's a link to the original song.
