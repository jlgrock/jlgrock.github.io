So my buddy did a JQuery rehash for people in our company.  In my opinion, it doesn't need to be sold.  People like JQuery cause it is easy and the learning curve to do some things is easy.  It follows the old Perl mantra: "Try to make simple things easy, and complex things possible".  Few folks can argue with that.

More interesting, in my opinion, than the subject material, was his choice of presentation tools.  He chose to use the [ImpressJS](https://github.com/bartaz/impress.js) library. It functions like [Prezi](https://prezi.com), but with WAY more configuration options (pretty much anything you can think of doing to the DOM).

He posted his presentation on his website [here](http://davidsouther.github.com/jQuery-Best-Parts-presentation/#/title) and put the code up on GitHub [here](https://github.com/DavidSouther/jQuery-Best-Parts-presentation).
