# Unit Testing Primer

I had realized I had covered some [Basics of Java Testing](/2012/2012-05-15-testing-in-java) in a thread almost a 
decade ago (and they still work)
 
## Why To write Unit Tests?
First off, let's dispel a myth.  The goal of unit tests is **not** to show if your code works.  Itâ€™s to make sure 
it meets requirements and continues to work, long after you are gone.

## Testing Methodologies
### Test Driven Development (TDD)
The general idea of TDD is to write the tests to the requirements, then write the code to the tests.  Vital to agile 
development methodologies.

### Behavior Driven Development

## Models of Unit Tests
Most follow the AAA Model - Arrange, Act, Assert.  Similar patterns exists called Data Driven Testing, which use the 
terms - Given, When, then/expect.  Some frameworks forcibly divide these (see Spock Testing, for a good example).  
These all basically mean the same thing, set your environment, make an action, test that the action did what was 
expected.


## Isolating your Tests
The hardest part, by far, is isolating your test so that a single unit test can tell you exactly
where the code has broken.
