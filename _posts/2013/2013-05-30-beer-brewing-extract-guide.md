This information is readily available around the internet.  Home Brewing has become a regular pastime of tons of people in the US.  Unfortunately everyone who gets into it ends up getting really heavy into it and forgets that folks that are just learning aren't going to understand what they are talking about.  So I thought I would put a quick cheat-sheet together for those just getting into home brewing.  If you want to learn more of the advanced concepts and techniques, please check out the [brewing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brewing) or [homebrewing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homebrewing) article on Wikipedia and start checking out the many blogs out there.

## Equipment
A lot of these can be bought in a kit and just add the extras on later.  My suggestion, go to your local brewery supplier.  They probably need the money and can provide you with tons of insights to any questions that you might have.

* Pot - You have to boil the water and add things. Basically, you need a big soup pot, 5-10 gallon.
* Spoon - You should have a really decent spoon
* Bucket - Bucket Lid drilled for air lock
* Bottle for Yeast (optional) - A growler or another similar bottle for the yeast starter
* Air Lock(s) - Essentially a P-trap that lets out gasses, but doesn't let anything in
* Siphon - helps you transfer beer from one container to another (in a fairly sanitary way)
* 50 non-screw top brown bottles (or one 5-gallon Cornelius Keg - for the kegerator making folks)
* Fine strainer - For straining out particulates after fermentation is completed
* Hydrometer - measures density, and thus sugar content (which translates to eventual alcohol content)
* Your favorite Brew kit - something [like this](http://rogue.com/store/products/Dead-Guy-Homebrew-Kit.html).

## Step 1: Yeast Starter (optional)
The process of getting the yeast to start eating and reproducing so that they aren't shocked when you throw them into 
the the wort. Some people skip this step by just sprinkling dry yeast into the wort at the end, but in my opinion, 
this is a mistake that can cause a bad batch because you might accidentally kill the yeast if your beer is a little 
less than optimal or you might need to wait longer until you beer will be ready.

In a pot, add one quart of filtered water and 1/2 cup of dry extract.  Boil this for about 10 minutes.  Rapid cool 
this using a sink of ice to about 70℉.  Pour into a sanitized bottle, add the yeast, and then shake vigorously to 
oxidize the solution.  Leave this to sit from anywhere from 5-24 hours.

For a nice video tutorial, watch this:

## Step 2: Cleaning
Clean everything, getting all of the residual gunk off of bottles and tools.  Then sanitize the bottles and fermenting 
tools, either by boiling, hot air, or using a quick sanitizer.  Make sure that nothing in the wort comes into contact 
with anything that hasn't been sanitized.  This is especially true after the cooling.  This is probably the most 
important part in the whole process, even though it is not very exciting.

## Step 3: Malting & Lautering
The process of fertilizing grains, letting them start to grow, and hitting them with hot water, then separating the 
sugars from the grains. The more advanced home brewers will do this themselves, or at least do this in part.  For 
the beginner, ignore this.  You will buy a malt extract in a can (syrup) or in a bag (powder) form.  When you get 
better at this, you can perform what is called "all-grain" brewing.

If you really want to do this, watch [this series of videos](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bC2HqcQR6PQ) for 
malting Barley.  It's a bit of an involved process.

## Step 4: Mashing
This is the fun part of brewing.  Some people call this "boiling" or "steeping".  It's pretty much taking grains 
and putting them into a grain bag (aka muslin bag) and letting it steep in boiling water in the same way that you 
would add a tea bag to a cup of tea.  Some of the hops are also added directly to the water at this point as well to 
add bitterness and aroma.

So, fill a pot with about 3 gallons of water.  Add the bag of grains while the water is still cold.  Heat it up to 155℉.  
Try and keep the grain bag from touching the sides of the pot, as it will burn/melt.

Keep the steeping over 150℉ and below 180℉ - the ideal conditions are to boil for 25 minutes at 155℉.  Keeping the 
temperature above 150℉ will break down the grain.  The type of grain you use will determine the majority of the color 
and flavor that is perceived. Do not exceed 180℉ - This is because if you heat it above 180℉, it will start to break 
down the husk of the grain.  You do not want the husks to impart their tannins into your brew.  Don't cover the pot as 
sulfur compounds that are being produced need a chance to escape.

Resist squeezing the grain bag as you want to avoid imparting any tannins from the grain husks.  If you want to make 
sure to get all of the good stuff out of the grain bag, I suggest running a couple of cups of hot water over the 
grain bag to flush it out.

Adding hops in the beginning of the steeping will impart bitterness to the beer at this point.  You can control the 
bitterness by understanding the amount of alpha acid you will be imparting to your beer.  This is determined by the 
original alpha acid amount and the length of time that the hops are boiled for.  Adding hops at the end (the last 5 
minutes or so) of the steeping will impart aroma.

## Step 5: Wort Cooling
You want to cool down the wort as fast as possible.  This is due to the fact that the sulfur compounds are still being 
produced as long as the temperature is high.  These will give your beer a slight egg smell/taste.  Also, the faster 
you cool down the wort, the more oxygen will be absorbed by the wort, which will facilitate yeast growth. In general. 
the faster you cool it down, the better.

When I first started, I simply filled a sink or tub with ice and immersed the entire pot.  Essentially, this is 
what [these guys did](http://youtu.be/u1Un5N-mCfU).  If you enjoy brewing, and end up doing it a lot, I 
suggest purchasing a 25 ft or 50 ft copper tubing wort chiller which looks like 
[this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qW0MbZPfmiQ), as these will chill the wort significantly faster than the ice 
bath and is a lot less messy.

Bring the temperature down to about 80-100℉ (You are going to want it to be at 70℉ after the water is added, so 
whatever it takes to accomplish that).

Don't let the beer sit around too long once and make sure to only use sanitized equipment once it reaches 140℉, as 
bacteria can start to grow in here.  If a small enough amount of bacteria gets in here, it's not a big deal, as the 
yeast will likely kill it off in the fermentation process.

## Step 6: Primary Fermentation
Once cooled, pour vigorously into your fermentation bucket.  I would suggest a bucket and not a glass carboy as this 
may lead to vigorous fermentation can cause it to explode, sending glass all over the place. To help facilitate yeast 
growth, I'd suggest wisking the wort (though this is not necessary).  Add cold water to the bucket to bring the total 
volume of the wort to 5 gallons.  Adding this water should also bring the temperature of the wort down to 65℉-75℉.

Grab a sample of the wort and your hydrometer to measure the specific gravity (or density of the water, based on 
sugar content), as described in [this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IiG9BqtoKcc).  What they don't tell you 
in these videos is that you can add a little more finishing (corn) sugar to the batch if you want to bring up the 
alcohol content.  I wouldn't add too much,  because you don't want to change the flavor of the beer.

If you are doing something that requires dry hopping (adding hops in the fermentation process), you can add the 
hops and they will just float on top.

Add your yeast starter, or if you skipped that step, just add the dry yeast.  Add the bucket top with airlock filled 
about half way with sanitizing solution, and just wait 7 days (or when the foam starts to disappear) to test your 
gravity again.  Once it is at about 1.010, you can transfer to secondary fermentation, or if you are skipping 
secondary, wait until it drops to about 1.004.  These numbers are approximate, so don't worry if they aren't exact.

Put this in a cool dark place for  7 days.  For an ale, you want to keep this around 70℉, for a lager you want to keep 
them around 50℉.  There's a great article 
[here](http://byo.com/stories/item/1869-controlling-fermentation-temperature-techniques) about controlling the 
fermentation temperature.  Make sure to check occasionally that the airlock doesn't get blocked up by foam and clean 
it out and replace it if it does.

## Step 7: Secondary Fermentation (optional)
You can skip Secondary Fermentation if you just keep it in the Primary Fermentation stage for 14 days, but you have 
to keep an eye on it to bottle/keg it to avoid autolysis.

Secondary Fermentation allows you not to worry about autolysis (when dead yeast at the bottom starts to contribute 
yeast flavors to the beer).  It's not necessary, but I suggest it.  I use a glass carboy for this step, but you can 
keep it in a bucket in this step as well.  To transfer it, I use a siphon with a hose.  This is because the yeast has
become anaerobic and thus you should avoid adding much additional oxygen (don't stir too much).

Let this batch sit for another 7 days.

## Step 8: Filtering and Bottling/Kegging
After your batch has completed, we need to siphon the liquid into our bottling bucket or keg through a strainer.  
Using your bottling bucket, pour the liquid from your bottling bucket into a bottle and cap.  Repeat until you are 
out of brew.

Let these bottles sit for 3-4 weeks to finish.

## Extra Credit: All Grain Brewing
If you understand the following and you've tried it a couple of times, the following video is good for understanding 
all-grain brewing.  The advantage to all-grain brewing is that you can make way more malts than you can purchase at a 
local brewery supply.  They tend to carry the popular ones.  The downside is that it takes 3-4 hours to boil/steep, as 
compared to the 1 hour that an extract takes to steep.  So, just be prepared to spend a little extra time if you do 
this, but a lot of people are much happier about the freshness of the flavor and the aroma and the different recipes 
that you can make.  I'm not about to start the "which is better?" war, but you get the idea.
